// Challenging Yourself:
// I Usually Dont Do This, But Today, I Have Made This Subrepo,
// Just For A Challenge, So You Test And Challenge Yourself,
// Because, You Cant Just Keep Watching And Reading This Without Being Tested,
// So, In This Subrepo, The Challenge Will Be, That You Implement,
// The "Divide And Conquer" Technique, Which,
// I Dont Remember If I've Told You Before, But Basically,
// You Divide The Main Problem Into Smaller Sub-Problems,
// And Then Solve Each Sub-Problem Individually,
// Because The Sub-Problems Are Easier To Solve Obviously,
// So You First Identify The Main Problem,
// Ask Questions To Yourself Of What To Do And How,
// So You First Understand The Main Problem, Then Divide It Into Sub-Problems,
// And So The Main Problem Will Be Solved, And Even If You Can't Solve It,
// Perfectly Or Just Werent Able To, Then Its Alright😄! Because,
// I Just Want To Make You Use All Of Your Mind, Skills And Knowledge That You Have,
// So If You Test This Method Out, Its Fine Even If You Fail,
// And Dont Even THINK About Worrying If You Didnt Do It Perfectly😅,
// Because You Didnt Fail, And Doind It Your Own Way?
// Thats Way Better Than Even Doing It Perfectly!,
// Because Your Finding And Developing Your Own Coding Style😁,
// So, I Hope You Atleast Tried To Solve It, And Didnt Just Skip It,
// Anyways, Here's Challenge:

/* Given An Array Of Forecasted Maximum Temperatures,
The Thermometer Displays A String With These Temperatures,
Example: [17, 21, 23] Will Print "... 17°C In 1 Days... 21°C In 2 Days... 23°C In 3 Days..."
Your Tasks:
1. Create A Function 'printForecast' Which Takes In An Array 'arr',
And Logs A String Like The Above To The Console.
Try It With Both Test Data Sets,

2. Use The Problem-Solving Framework:
Understand The Problem, And Break It Up Into Sub-Problems!

Test Data:
Data 1: [17, 21, 23]
Data 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
*/

// So You Can Solve It In The Large Empty Space Below,
// Or Just Create A Separate JS File For It,
// But I Am Saying This Again, At Least Try To Solve It Yourself,
// Now, If You Want To Find The Answer, Then Just Go To The answer.js File,
// So Finally, Good Luck, And All The Best, Even If You Failed But Tried😅!
