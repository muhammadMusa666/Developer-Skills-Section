# This Subrepo Is Also Made For Another Challenge, And This Is Also, Unexpectedly, The Last Subrepo In This Repo! So This Developer-Skills Section Was Really Short Surprisingly, But Who Cares? Less Things To Learn😆, But Anyways, This Challenge Focuses On You Using AI To Help You Code, And I Did So With My Answer In The answer.js File, Which Took Some Time To Fix, Because AI's Code Can Have Alot Of Bugs, And You Might Need To Constantly Ask The AI, To Update The Code It Makes, And I Recommend You Actually Use AI Instead Of Doing It On Your Own, Because My Code Uses AI, And You Wont Get It Because The AI Will Use Code That We Havent Learnt Yet😅, And This Reminds Me, You Can Ask The AI To Explain The Code It Makes And Certain Points Of It, Also, Your AI's Code Will Likely Not Match My Answer, Because Each AI Does It Differently😉, So Dont Worry About It, Anyways, Let Me Know If You Encounter Any Errors, See In You In The Next Section😄. And Finally Once Again...I Hope U Like It🫡!
