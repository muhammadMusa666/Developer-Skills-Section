// Challenge #2 With AI:
// This Is The 2nd Challenge, And Surprisingly, This Is The Last Subrepo,
// Yes! So In This 2nd Challenge, We Will Use AI,
// Now I Made Another Challenge Before This, And I Kind Of,
// Dont Make Challenge Subrepos, So I'll Keep This 2nd Challenge Short,
// And By The Way, You Can Use Any AI You Like, I Will Be Using Chatgpt,
// Or Kilo Code, So, Lets Begin With The Challenge!
// Note: You Must Use AI's For This Challenge, Because This Is Revolved Around It,
// And It Uses JavaScript Features We Havent Learned About Yet,
// So You Can Try To Solve It Yourself, But Chances Are You Wont,

// So Here's The Challenge:
// Lets Say Your Building A Time-Tracking Application,
// Built For Freelancers, And At Some Point, You'll Need A function,
// That Receives, Daily Work Hours For A Certain Week,
// And Then It Will Return 5 Data Points, So:
// 1: Total Hours Worked,
// 2: Average Daily Hours,
// 3: The Day With The Most Hours Worked,
// 4: Number Of Days Worked,
// 5: Wether The Week Was Full-Time (Worked 35 Hours Or More),

// Challenge Data:[7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0];

// Now You Can Solve All Of This With AI,
// But There Is A High Chance For Bugs Or Other Stuff,
// So Always Check Your Code If You Copied It From An AI,
// Its Less Likely If You Use A Coding AI Like Kil Code,
// Now You Can Solve This In The Large Area Below, Or In Another File,
// And If You Want To Find The Answer, Then Just Go To The answer.js File,
// So, Good Luck!

// (Side-Note: You Can Use The Same AI, To Explain The Stuff In The AI's Given Code,
// Because There Is A High Chance That You Dont Understand Some Parts Of The Code,
// So I Recommend You Doing So, Now You Can Continue The Challenge😅)
